Automated Fiber Quantification in Python (pyAFQ)
-------------------------------------------------

pyAFQ is an open-source software tool for the analysis of brain white matter in
diffusion MRI measurements. It implements a complete and automated data
processing pipeline for tractometry, from raw DTI data to white matter tract
identification, as well as quantification of tissue properties along the length
of the major long-range brain white matter connections.

- To get started, please refer to the `getting started <tutorials/index.html>`_ page. In particular, these two examples are very useful:

  - This example shows you how to run pyAFQ on a BIDS dataset, where pyAFQ
    uses the BIDS structure to find necessary files:
    `Getting started with pyAFQ - GroupAFQ <tutorials/tutorial_examples/plot_001_group_afq_api.html>`_
  - This example shows you how to run pyAFQ on any dataset,
    where input file paths are given explicitly:
    `Getting started with pyAFQ - ParticipantAFQ <tutorials/tutorial_examples/plot_002_participant_afq_api.html>`_
- What is the difference between tractography and tractometry? See in the `explanations <explanations/index.html>`_ page.
- For more detailed information on the variety of uses of pyAFQ, see the `how to <howto/index.html>`_ page. In particular, this one example is useful for understanding tractometry:

  - `Understanding the different stages of tractometry with videos <howto/howto_examples/plot_stages_of_tractometry.html>`_
- For a detailed description of the methods and objects used in pyAFQ, see the `reference documentation <reference/index.html>`_ page.

Here are some useful reference pages:

- For a list of the major fiber tracts supported by pyAFQ, see the `Major Fiber Tracts <reference/fibertracts.html>`_ page.
- For a list of the supported tissue properties, see the `Tissue Properties <reference/tissue_properties.html>`_ page.
- For a grand list of all pyAFQ outputs, see `The pyAFQ API methods <reference/methods.html>`_.
- For a grand list of all pyAFQ arguments, see `The pyAFQ API optional arguments <reference/kwargs.html>`_.
