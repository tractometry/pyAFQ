Exporting pyAFQ Results
======================================

This example shows how to use the ``export`` methods to obtain results from
the ParticipantAFQ object. The ``export`` methods are used to calculate
derived quantities from the data, such as DTI parameters, tract profiles,
and bundle segmentations.

# In this example, we will create a ParticipantAFQ object based on the
# :doc:`plot_002_participant_afq_api` example. Please refer to that
# example for a detailed description of the parameters.

##########################################################################
# The Export Method
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# The ParticipantAFQ object has a method called ``export``, which allows the user
# to calculate various derived quantities from the data.
#
# The ``export`` method can be called with a string argument that specifies the
# type of quantity to be calculated. For example, ``myafq.export("OPTIONS")``.
#
# To list the available options, you can call the ``export`` method with the
# argument "help". This will return a list of all the available options for
# the ``export`` method.

myafq.export("help")

##########################################################################
# .. note::
#
#    No all options are possible even if they are valid. This will depend on
#    you dataset and pyAFQ API parameters. For example, you cannot calculate
#    DKI model from single shell data. Please refer to
#    :doc:`/howto/tractography_params` for more documentation.


##########################################################################
# Calculating DTI FA (Diffusion Tensor Imaging Fractional Anisotropy)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# FA can be computed using the DTI model, by explicitly calling
# ``myafq.export("dti_fa")``. This triggers the computation of DTI parameters,
# and stores the results in the AFQ derivatives directory. In addition, it
# calculates the FA from these parameters and stores it in a different file in
# the same directory.
#
# .. note::
#
#    The AFQ API computes quantities lazily. This means that DTI parameters
#    are not computed until they are required. This means that the first
#    line below is the one that requires time.
#
# The result of the call to ``export`` is the filename of the corresponding FA
# files.

FA_fname = myafq.export("dti_fa")


##########################################################################
# Recognizing the bundles and calculating tract profiles:
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Typically, users of pyAFQ are interested in calculating not only an overall
# map of the FA, but also the major white matter pathways (or bundles) and
# tract profiles of tissue properties along their length. To trigger the
# pyAFQ pipeline that calculates the profiles, users can call the
# ``export("profiles")`` method:
#
# .. note::
#    Running the code below triggers the full pipeline of operations
#    leading to the computation of the tract profiles. Therefore, it
#    takes a little while to run (about 40 minutes, typically).

myafq.export("profiles")

##########################################################################
# Visualizing the bundles and calculating tract profiles:
# -----------------------------------------------------
# The pyAFQ API provides several ways to visualize bundles and profiles.
#
# First, we will run a function that exports an html file that contains
# an interactive visualization of the bundles that are segmented.
#
# .. note::
#    By default we resample a 100 points within a bundle, however to reduce
#    processing time we will only resample 50 points.
#
# Once it is done running, it should pop a browser window open and let you
# interact with the bundles.
#
# .. note::
#    You can hide or show a bundle by clicking the legend, or select a
#    single bundle by double clicking the legend. The interactive
#    visualization will also all you to pan, zoom, and rotate.

bundle_html = myafq.export("all_bundles_figure")
plotly.io.show(bundle_html[0])


##########################################################################
# The Export All Method
# -----------------------------------------------------
# There is a ``export_all`` method that will export all the results from the
# AFQ pipeline. Undeerneath the hood, ``export_all`` calls a series of ``export``
# methods. This method was added for convenience, and is the recommended method
# to use when you want to export everything the results from the AFQ pipeline.
#
# This method will export the following results, if possible:
# - Transformation maps and files
# - Start and stop mask images, associated diffusion scalar files
# - Tractography, segmented tractography in to bundles
# - Tract profiles, streamline counts, median tract length
# - Visuzalizations of the bundles and tract profiles

myafq.export_all()

##########################################################################
# The Export Up To Method
# -----------------------------------------------------
# The ``export_up_to`` method allows you to export results up to a certain
# point (but not including) in the AFQ pipeline.
#
# For example, if you want to export all the results up to the bundle
# segmentation step, you can call the ``export_up_to`` method with the
# argument "bundles". This will export all the required derivatives
# prior to the bundle segmentation step, where you can then take the
# derivatives and debug your own custom segmentation pipeline.

myafq.export_up_to("bundles")
