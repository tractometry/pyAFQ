              connections in a group of children with a wide range of reading
              abilities. We segmented the callosal fibers into regions based on
              their likely cortical projection zones, and we measured diffusion
              properties in these segmented regions. Phonological awareness (a
              key factor in reading acquisition) was positively correlated with
              diffusivity perpendicular to the main axis of the callosal fibers
              that connect the temporal lobes. These results could be explained
              by several physiological properties. For example, good readers may
              have fewer but larger axons connecting left and right temporal
              lobes, or their axon membranes in these regions may be more
              permeable than the membranes of poor readers. These measurements

               Sury, Dana and Gracco, Vincent and Ben-Shachar, Michal",
  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Individuals with persistent developmental
               stuttering display deficits in aligning motor actions to
               external cues (i.e., sensorimotor synchronization). Diffusion
               imaging studies point to stuttering-associated differences in
               dorsal, not ventral, white matter pathways, and in the
               cerebellar peduncles. Here, we studied microstructural white
               matter differences between adults who stutter (AWS) and fluent
               speakers using two complementary approaches to: (a) assess
               previously reported group differences in white matter
               diffusivity, and (b) evaluate the relationship between white
               matter diffusivity and sensorimotor synchronization in each
               group. METHODS: Participants completed a sensorimotor
               synchronization task and a diffusion MRI scan. We identified the
               cerebellar peduncles and major dorsal- and ventral-stream
               language pathways in each individual and assessed correlations
               between sensorimotor synchronization and diffusion measures
               along the tracts. RESULTS: The results demonstrated group
               differences in dorsal, not ventral, language tracts, in
               alignment with prior reports. Specifically, AWS had
               significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left
               arcuate fasciculus, and significantly higher mean diffusivity
               (MD) in the bilateral frontal aslant tract compared to fluent
               speakers, while no significant group difference was detected in
               the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. We also found
               significant group differences in both FA and MD of the left
               middle cerebellar peduncle. Comparing patterns of association
               with sensorimotor synchronization revealed a novel double
               dissociation: MD within the left inferior cerebellar peduncle
               was significantly correlated with mean asynchrony in AWS but not
               in fluent speakers, while FA within the left arcuate fasciculus
               was significantly correlated with mean asynchrony in fluent
               speakers, but not in AWS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the
               view that stuttering involves altered connectivity in dorsal
               tracts and that AWS may rely more heavily on cerebellar tracts
               to process timing information. Evaluating microstructural
               associations with sensitive behavioral measures provides a
               powerful tool for discovering additional functional differences
               in the underlying connectivity in AWS.",

               single-subject main sulci were first delineated and further used
               as landmarks for the 3D definition of 45 anatomical volumes of
               interest (AVOI) in each hemisphere. This procedure was performed
               using a dedicated software which allowed a 3D following of the
               sulci course on the edited brain. Regions of interest were then
               drawn manually with the same software every 2 mm on the axial
               slices of the high-resolution MNI single subject. The 90 AVOI
               were reconstructed and assigned a label. Using this parcellation
               method, three procedures to perform the automated anatomical
               labeling of functional studies are proposed: (1) labeling of an
               extremum defined by a set of coordinates, (2) percentage of

               belonging to each of the AVOI intersected by an activated
               cluster. An interface with the Statistical Parametric Mapping
               package (SPM, J. Ashburner and K. J. Friston, 1999, Hum. Brain
               Mapp. 7, 254-266) is provided as a freeware to researchers of
               the neuroimaging community. We believe that this tool is an
               improvement for the macroscopical labeling of activated area
               compared to labeling assessed using the Talairach atlas brain in
               which deformations are well known. However, this tool does not

               Thirty-eight children participated in a cross-sectional study
               including diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
               magnetoencephalography (MEG) sessions. During the MEG
               acquisition, participants performed a lexical decision and a
               fixation task on words presented at varying levels of contrast
               and noise. For all stimuli and tasks, early evoked fields were
               observed around 100 ms after stimulus onset (M100), with slower
               and lower amplitude responses for low as compared to high
               contrast stimuli. The optic radiations and optic tracts were
               identified in each individual's brain based on diffusion MRI
               tractography. The diffusion properties of the optic radiations
               predicted M100 responses, especially for high contrast stimuli.
               Higher optic radiation fractional anisotropy (FA) values were
               associated with faster and larger M100 responses. Over this
               developmental window, the M100 responses to high contrast
               stimuli became faster with age and the optic radiation FA
               mediated this effect. These findings suggest that the maturation

              difficult spelling-to-dictation task and microstructural
              properties of language-related white matter pathways, in a sample
              of 73 native English-speaking neurotypical adults. Participants
              completed a diffusion magnetic resonance imaging scan and a
              cognitive assessment battery. Using constrained spherical
              deconvolution modeling and probabilistic tractography, we
              reconstructed dorsal and ventral white matter tracts of interest,
              bilaterally, in individual participants. Spelling associations
              were found in both dorsal and ventral stream pathways. In
              high-performing spellers, spelling scores significantly
              correlated with fractional anisotropy (FA) within the left
              inferior longitudinal fasciculus, a ventral stream pathway. In
              low-performing spellers, spelling scores significantly correlated
              with FA within the third branch of the right superior
              longitudinal fasciculus, a dorsal pathway. An automated analysis
              of spelling errors revealed that high- and low- performing
              spellers also differed in their error patterns, diverging
              primarily in terms of the orthographic distance between their
              errors and the correct spelling, compared to the phonological
              plausibility of their spelling responses. The results demonstrate
              the complexity of the neurocognitive architecture of spelling.
              The distinct white matter associations and error patterns
              detected in low- and high- performing spellers suggest that they
              rely on different cognitive processes, such that high-performing
              spellers rely more on lexical-orthographic representations, while
              low-performing spellers rely more on phoneme-to-grapheme
              conversion.",

They also motivate the need for fully automatic algorithms for finding white matter bundles. One popular algorithm, Automated Fiber Quantification (AFQ), has been shown to be reliable for analyzing a suite of large bundles. Here, we demonstrate that this approach can be extended to a relatively small white matter bundle, the optic tract. We develop an automated method that finds a portion of this bundle automatically. We compare the automatically found optic tract to optic tracts previously found using an algorithm that requires expert intervention, and find high degree of overlap. While previous methods work well in high-quality data, we demonstrate that the novel method proposed here generalizes broadly in subjects from three different datasets with differing data quality and a broad age range. Finally, we describe how this approach could be easily extended to other small bundles.",

              important factor underlying many cognitive and neurological
              disorders. In vivo, tissue properties may vary systematically
              along each tract for several reasons: different populations of
              axons enter and exit the tract, and disease can strike at local
              positions within the tract. Hence quantifying and understanding
              diffusion measures along each fiber tract (Tract Profile) may
              reveal new insights into white matter development, function, and
              disease that are not obvious from mean measures of that tract. We
              demonstrate several novel findings related to Tract Profiles in
              the brains of typically developing children and children at risk
              for white matter injury secondary to preterm birth. First,
              fractional anisotropy (FA) values vary substantially within a
              tract but the Tract FA Profile is consistent across subjects.
              Thus, Tract Profiles contain far more information than mean
              diffusion measures. Second, developmental changes in FA occur at
              specific positions within the Tract Profile, rather than along
              the entire tract. Third, Tract Profiles can be used to compare
              white matter properties of individual patients to standardized
              Tract Profiles of a healthy population to elucidate unique
              features of that patient's clinical condition. Fourth, Tract
              Profiles can be used to evaluate the association between white
              matter properties and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, in the

              measured at specific locations on the left arcuate and left
              superior longitudinal fasciculus and the magnitude of the

              is to segment white matter bundles and make virtual dissection
              easier to perform. This can help explore large tractograms from
              multiple persons directly in their native space. RecoBundles
              leverages latest state-of-the-art streamline-based registration
              and clustering to recognize and extract bundles using prior
              bundle models. RecoBundles uses bundle models as shape priors for
              detecting similar streamlines and bundles in tractograms.
              RecoBundles is 100\% streamline-based, is efficient to work with

              It is also robust to pathological brains with tumors and

               potential for neuroscience. In the last decade, fiber tracking
               has become the method of choice to investigate quantitative MRI
               parameters in specific bundles of white matter. For
               neurosurgeons, it is quickly becoming an invaluable tool for the
               planning of surgery, allowing for visualization and localization
               of important white matter pathways before and even during
               surgery. Fiber tracking has also claimed a central role in the
               field of ``connectomics,'' a technique that builds and studies
               comprehensive maps of the complex network of connections within
               the brain, and to which significant resources have been
               allocated worldwide. Despite its unique abilities and exciting
               applications, fiber tracking is not without controversy, in
               particular when it comes to its interpretation. As
               neuroscientists are eager to study the brain's connectivity, the
               quantification of tractography-derived ``connection strengths''
               between distant brain regions is becoming increasingly popular.
               However, this practice is often frowned upon by fiber-tracking
               experts. In light of this controversy, this paper provides an
               overview of the key concepts of tractography, the technical
               considerations at play, and the different types of tractography
               algorithm, as well as the common misconceptions and mistakes
               that surround them. We also highlight the ongoing challenges
               related to fiber tracking. While recent methodological
               developments have vastly increased the biological accuracy of
               fiber tractograms, one should be aware that, even with
               state-of-the-art techniques, many issues that severely bias the

              data, overcoming the crossing fibre limitations inherent in the
              diffusion tensor model. It is routinely used to obtain high
              quality fibre orientation distribution function (fODF) estimates
              and fibre tractograms and is increasingly used to obtain apparent
              fibre density (AFD) measures. Unfortunately, CSD typically only
              supports data acquired on a single shell in q-space. With
              multi-shell data becoming more and more prevalent, there is a
              growing need for CSD to fully support such data. Furthermore, CSD
              can only provide high quality fODF estimates in voxels containing
              WM only. In voxels containing other tissue types such as grey
              matter (GM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the WM response

              volume fraction maps, directly from the DW data, whereas SSST-CSD
              has a tendency to overestimate the WM volume in voxels containing

              substantially increase the precision of the fODF fibre
              orientations and reduce the presence of spurious fODF peaks in
              voxels containing GM and/or CSF. Both effects translate into more
              reliable AFD measures and tractography results with MSMT-CSD

  abstract = "Tractography based on non-invasive diffusion imaging is central
              to the study of human brain connectivity. To date, the approach
              has not been systematically validated in ground truth studies.
              Based on a simulated human brain data set with ground truth
              tracts, we organized an open international tractography
              challenge, which resulted in 96 distinct submissions from 20
              research groups. Here, we report the encouraging finding that
              most state-of-the-art algorithms produce tractograms containing
              90\% of the ground truth bundles (to at least some extent).
              However, the same tractograms contain many more invalid than
              valid bundles, and half of these invalid bundles occur
              systematically across research groups. Taken together, our
              results demonstrate and confirm fundamental ambiguities inherent
              in tract reconstruction based on orientation information alone,
              which need to be considered when interpreting tractography and
              connectivity results. Our approach provides a novel framework for
              estimating reliability of tractography and encourages innovation
              to address its current limitations.",
